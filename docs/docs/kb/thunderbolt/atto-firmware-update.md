# SymplyPRO Thunderbolt – Updating ATTO SAS firmware (bridge)

Some Thunderbolt units use an internal ATTO SAS chip. Identify your exact bridge model, then apply the matching firmware package. Read all steps before starting and **do not interrupt** the update.

High‑level flow:
1. Identify the SAS bridge (by chassis serial and legend).
2. Install the correct driver/tooling.
3. Apply the matching firmware package.
4. Reboot/power‑cycle as instructed and verify.
