# LTO firmware downloads (overview)

Keep your LTO drive firmware current for stability and compatibility. Verify versions using **SymplyATOM** or IBM **ITDT**.  
If an update fails, the driveâ€™s Single Character Display (SCD) may show an error; do not attempt updates while an error is shown. After updating with ITDT, run **SCAN FOR DRIVES** to confirm the new firmware is active.
