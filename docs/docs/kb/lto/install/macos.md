# SymplyPRO LTO (Thunderbolt): macOS installation

1. **Check what you need** – confirm the supplied Thunderbolt cable and power cord, and a compatible macOS version.
2. **Prepare the Mac** – Apple Silicon / T2 Macs block third‑party kernel extensions by default. Modify the Security Policy in Recovery to allow required extensions.
3. **Install SymplyATOM (combined installer)** – installs utilities and all drivers needed for SymplyLTO products.
4. **Connect & power on** – attach the Thunderbolt cable, power on the unit, and verify it appears in **About This Mac → System Report → Thunderbolt**.
5. **Open SymplyATOM** – confirm the drive appears under **Drives Found**.

Notes:
- Keep macOS and SymplyATOM updated.
- Use approved Thunderbolt 3/4 cables.
