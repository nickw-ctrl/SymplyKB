# macOS: Preparing TeamViewer for remote support

For some cases we may ask to connect remotely. On macOS, TeamViewer needs several permissions so we can see and control the screen.

## Steps (macOS Ventura / Sonoma / Sequoia)
1. Install and open TeamViewer or TeamViewer Host.
2. In TeamViewer, go to **Help → Check system access**.
3. For each item (**Screen Recording**, **Accessibility**, **Full Disk Access**, and **Remote Desktop** on newer macOS versions), click **Set up…** and enable TeamViewer.
4. Quit and reopen TeamViewer after changing permissions.

> You can remove these permissions any time in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
