# macOS: Preparing TeamViewer for remote support

If we request a remote session, macOS needs extra permissions for TeamViewer.

**Steps (Ventura / Sonoma / Sequoia)**
1. Open TeamViewer → **Help → Check system access**.
2. For **Screen Recording**, **Accessibility**, **Full Disk Access** (and **Remote Desktop** on newer macOS), click **Set up…** and enable TeamViewer.
3. Quit and reopen TeamViewer after changing permissions.

You can remove these permissions later in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
